好的！帮你优化一下，让它更简洁、更有冲击力：
markdown### 🏥 VIP Partners - Maternal Digital Platform (MDP)
**University of Michigan School of Nursing | Full-Stack & ML Engineer Intern**  
*Private Repository - Healthcare Application*

A **HIPAA-compliant AI-powered prenatal care platform** providing personalized nurse tutoring and educational resources for expectant mothers in Michigan.

---

#### 🎯 The Challenge
Nurses spent **80-120 minutes daily** on administrative tasks—manually searching medical news, creating patient summaries, and answering repetitive questions—taking time away from actual patient care.

---

#### 💡 My Solution & Contributions

**As Full-Stack Developer:**

🏗️ **Backend Architecture**
- Designed and implemented RESTful API with **Flask (Python)** for patient management and scheduling
- Built **Oracle database** schema for user profiles, appointments, and medical records
- Implemented secure authentication with JWT and role-based access control

💻 **Frontend Development**
- Developed responsive React interface for patient portal and nurse dashboard
- Built real-time scheduling system with conflict detection
- Integrated **TypeScript** for type-safe component development

🔐 **Security & Performance**
- Achieved **HIPAA compliance** with AES-256 encryption for PHI (SSN, medical history)
- Implemented **Redis session caching**, reducing login latency by 80% (500ms → 50ms)
- Designed role-based access control ensuring data privacy

**As Machine Learning Engineer:**

🤖 **Automated Medical News Aggregation**
- Built **n8n** workflow automating daily medical news scraping and filtering
- Deployed **Slack integration** delivering pregnancy-related updates to nursing staff
- **Impact:** Eliminated 60+ minutes of daily manual research

🧠 **RAG-Powered Q&A System**
- Developed **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system using **Deepseek-V3 LLM**
- Built vector database indexing medical literature and nursing guidelines
- Implemented semantic search for instant, context-aware medical answers
- **Impact:** Reduced query response time from 5-10 minutes (manual search) to <2 seconds

📊 **Intelligent Task Generation**
- Designed AI system generating personalized care task lists based on patient profiles
- Automated reminder workflows for appointments and medication schedules

---

#### 🛠️ Technical Stack

**Backend:** Flask (Python), Oracle DB, Redis  
**Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS  
**AI/ML:** Deepseek-V3 LLM, RAG Architecture, Vector Embeddings  
**Automation:** n8n Workflow Platform, Slack API  
**DevOps:** Docker, Git (93+ commits), CI/CD  
**Security:** JWT Auth, AES-256 Encryption, HIPAA Compliance

---

#### 📈 Key Achievements

✅ **Deployed to University of Michigan School of Nursing** serving **20+ healthcare providers**

✅ **75% reduction** in daily administrative time (80-120 min → 20 min)

✅ **80% faster login** through Redis caching optimization (500ms → 50ms)

✅ **Instant medical guideline access** via RAG system vs. manual document searches

✅ **HIPAA-compliant** encrypted patient data management

✅ **93+ commits** in collaborative team environment with 5+ developers
