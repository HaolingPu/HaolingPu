### 🏥 VIP Partners - Maternal Digital Platform
**University of Michigan School of Nursing | Full-Stack & ML Engineer Intern**  
*Private Repository*

HIPAA-compliant AI-powered prenatal care platform for expectant mothers and nursing staff.

#### 🎯 Problem → Solution
**Challenge:** Nurses spent 80-120 min/day on manual tasks (news search, patient summaries, Q&A)

**My Solution:**
- 🤖 **Automated Medical News Pipeline:** Built n8n workflow + Slack integration → eliminated 60+ min/day
- 🧠 **RAG Q&A System:** Deepseek-V3 LLM + vector search → instant medical guideline queries (10 min → 2 sec)
- 🔐 **HIPAA-Compliant Security:** JWT auth + Redis caching + AES-256 encryption → 80% faster login
- 🏗️ **Full-Stack Development:** Flask REST API + React UI + Oracle DB → scheduling system for 20+ users

#### 📈 Impact
✅ **75% reduction** in daily admin time (120 min → 20 min)  
✅ Deployed to **University of Michigan School of Nursing**  
✅ **93+ commits** in team of 5+ developers

**Tech:** Python, Flask, React, TypeScript, Deepseek-V3, RAG, n8n, Redis, Oracle, Docker
